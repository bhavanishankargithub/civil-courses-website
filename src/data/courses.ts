      "The Revit Structural Program by ReviNXT Academy is a 2+1 month live training designed for civil engineers to move beyond AutoCAD and master 3D structural modelling in Revit. Through real project-based learning, you'll model and detail complete structures â€” from a G+7 concrete building to a steel warehouse. Every session is practical, mentor-led, and focused on real construction workflows. By the end, you'll have a professional portfolio and the confidence to deliver structural projects with precision and speed.",
